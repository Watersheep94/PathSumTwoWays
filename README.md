# PathSumTwoWays
Project Euler Problem 81: Path Sum Two Ways

## Instructions
To run the program:
```
java -jar PathSumTwoWays.jar
```

## Why I Chose This Problem

This was another problem Adobe recommended. Path Sum Two Ways seemed like a classic algorithm problem from back in my Computer Science classes. I'd also seen similar problems on interview prep books and websites before so it seemed like a good contrast to the previous Poker Hands problem.

## Process

After thinking for awhile, I realized it was a well-known dyamic programming problem. From there, I just had to represent the matrix as a two-dimensional array and figure out how to apply DP. I also had to make sure I wasn't hitting any out of bounds exceptions on the matrix array.
